# Firewall-Rules

This repository contains my assignment submission to the course 'Logic in Computer Science' at BITS Pilani.

It is a **prolog** encoding of Firewall rules.

## Problem - Statement 

 Firewall rules are encoded in Prolog as facts and rules: each rule may start with accept (allow the incoming packet),         reject (send reject information to sender), or drop (silently) followed by a clause. [see documentation for syntax]

#### Documentation - 
[Firewall language rules](Firewall_rules_language.md) <br>
[Firewall language syntax](Firewall_rules_synatx.md)

Write a Prolog program to apply encoded rules on any incoming packet. Note that multiple rules may apply.
