Query Description :
	packet(A,B,V,P,C,D,E,F,G)

	NOTE : If user does not know value for a particular parameter then '-1' is to be passed ie Null case.
	NOTE: Atleast one input value needs to be specified from tcp ('C' and 'D') or udp ('E' and 'F').
	NOTE: Compulsory input required in 'B' ipv4 ie Ip address can't be null


1. Input format
packet(A,B,V,P,C,D,E,F,G,H) where :
			
  'A' is adapter value.
  		Format: list of strings, each string is a single small alphabet, 'any'.
  		Examples :  A = ["any"] 
  			    A = ["b","c"] 
  		            A = ["d"]
  	 
  'B' is ipv4 address 
  		Format a.b.c.d where each 'a','b,'c','d' is a number.
  		Examples : "100.3.255.56"

  'V' is ethernet vid value  .
  		Format: list of "number". 
  		Examples :  ["3"]
  			    ["65","100"]

  'P' is ethernet proto value 
   		Format: "number" or  "aarp", 'atalk', 'mpls', 'netbui', 'rarp', 'sna', 'xns', 'ipx', 'pppoe','arp' in list. 
   		Examples: 	        ["ipx", "pppoe"]
   					["ipx"]
   					["6"]
   					["5","7"]

  'C' is tcp source address 
  		Format : list of "number" 
  		Example:		["4"]
  					["7","22"]
  'D' is tcp destination address 
  		Format : list of "number"
  		Example:		["4"]
  					["7","22"]

  'E' is udp source address
  		Format : list of "number"
  		Example:		["4"]
  					["7","22"]	

  'F' is udp destination adddress
  		Format : list of strings
  		Example:		["4"]
  					["7","22"]

   'G' is icmp Type  
  		Format: list of strings 
  		Example: 	 ["2"]
  				 ["1"]
  				 ["-1"] (icmp input is absent, hence accepted)



									Database Rules  
			
1. Adapter 

	'any' is an acceptable adapter
	
	'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' accepted adapter 
	
	'f', 'g', 'h' rejected adapter values
	
	all other values are dropped by default

	Null value is taken as -1 and is accepted. 

	input can be a single adapter or a list of adapters. */


2.Ipv4 
	
	ipv4 is accepted if each of the number is between 101 to 255 

	ipv4 is rejected if each of the number is between 0 to 100


 3.Ethernet 
	
	ethernet proto clause is accepted if the input values from  'rarp','sna','xns', 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19.

	ethernet proto clause is rejected even if one of the input is in 'ipx,pppoe,arp,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9'  

	ethernet vid clause is rejected even if one of the input is range is 0 to 50. or null  

	ethernet vid clause is accepted if input number(s) lies between 51 to 399 



4. Tcp/ udp
	
	tcp is accepted if both tcp source and destination address are in accept range ie from 0 to 100

	tcp is rejected if either tcp source or destination address is in reject range ie from 101 to 200

	udp is accepted if both udp source and destination address are in accept range ie 0 to 200

	udp is rejected if either udp source or destination address is in reject range ie 201 to 500



5.  Icmp 

	accepted if icmp type is 0,1,25,50 

	-1 (i.e null ) is also accepted 

	rejected if icmp type is 2,11 and writes 'icmp rejection' on terminal
